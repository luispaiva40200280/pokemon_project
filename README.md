# Pokemon Project

This project is a web-based application that lets users search, sort, and browse through a list of Pokémon using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). The app is built with HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to provide a responsive and interactive experience.

## Features

- **Search Functionality:** Search Pokémon by name or ID.
- **Filter by Type:** Use the dropdown to filter Pokémon by their type (e.g., Fire, Water, Grass, etc.).
- **Sorting:** Sort Pokémon alphabetically.
- **Pagination and Scrolling:** Smooth scrolling and a scroll-up button for easy navigation.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main page with search and filter functionality.
- `detailsPage.html`: A placeholder page for Pokémon details (can be expanded).
- `script.js`: Core JavaScript logic for fetching, filtering, sorting, and displaying Pokémon data.
- `style.css`: (If you have one) Add your custom styles here.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS (with Bootstrap 5 for styling and layout)
- JavaScript (for dynamic functionality and API interactions)
